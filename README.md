Projects Page Clone

This repository contains a project where I recreated the "Projects" page from the official Spring website. The goal was to replicate the page's appearance and functionality as closely as possible while practicing modern web development techniques.

#Features
React: The project is built using React for creating reusable components and managing the UI state.
Redux: State management is implemented with Redux for handling complex state interactions in a predictable way.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

#Why This Project?
This project was developed as a practice exercise to enhance my skills in React and Redux. By copying an existing page, I focused on:

Understanding the structure and design of professional websites.
Reproducing real-world UI/UX elements with React components.
Managing state efficiently using Redux.
